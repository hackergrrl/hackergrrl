## Hi, I'm Kira. ðŸ¦Š

I like free & open source software a lot.

However, I don't like the business practices of GitHub nor Microsoft (GitHub's parent company), such as vendor lock-in.

I think open source projects should not be hosted by closed-source software, nor run by a large for-profit business. Ditto for [package managers](https://npmjs.com).

I think that AI is generally harmful, because this society hasn't learned to use it responsibly, re: [exploitation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/labelers-training-ai-say-theyre-overworked-underpaid-and-exploited-60-minutes-transcript/) in the training process, and re: the high energy demands (often sated [with fossil fuels](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-25/ai-needs-so-much-power-that-old-coal-plants-are-sticking-around)) they promote. (re: GitHub's Copilot product)

For these reasons I have decided to publish new work on Codeberg instead: https://codeberg.org/kira/

Another nice option is [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/).

I hope you look closely at GitHub and Microsoft as well, and consider making your own decision in line with your values.
